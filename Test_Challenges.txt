Test Challenges for jobs. (Things that I need to make sure I do).

1. Build a simple log in page (front end) that communicates with a simple api (backend). It also has client side validation.
If the inputs (username and password) are not correct then error messages will appear under the inputs.

2. Build a an app that can you can fill out a form and submit that to the api. The api must submit that form to the database.
JWT tokens must be used.
